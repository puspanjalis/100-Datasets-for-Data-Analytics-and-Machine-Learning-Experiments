# Hands-on-Practice: 20-Machine-Learning-Projects-on-NLP

## What is a dataset in machine learning?

To understand what a dataset is, we must first discuss the components of a dataset. A single row of data is called an instance. Datasets are a collection of instances that all share a common attribute. Machine learning models will generally contain a few different datasets, each used to fulfill various roles in the system.

For machine learning models to understand how to perform various actions, training datasets must first be fed into the machine learning algorithm, followed by validation datasets (or testing datasets) to ensure that the model is interpreting this data accurately.

Once you feed these training and validation sets into the system, subsequent datasets can then be used to sculpt your machine learning model going forward. The more data you provide to the ML system, the faster that model can learn and improve.

## What type of data does machine learning need?
Data can come in many forms, but machine learning models rely on four primary data types. These include *numerical data*, *categorical data*, *time series data*, and *text data*.
